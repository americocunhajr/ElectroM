**ElectroM - ElectroMechanical Dynamic Code**  is an easy-to-run code to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of an electromechanical system. The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive. 

## Software History

This code was developed to analyze the nonlinear dynamic behavior of a typical electromechanical system. Two physical-mathematical models are implemented in this package: (i) a full-order model which considers the mutual interaction between electrical and mechanical sub-systems, so that ODE's system is coupled; (ii) a reduced-order model which only considers the influence of the mechanical sub-systems into the electrical one, so that ODE's system is decoupled.

The underlying results are reported in the following paper:
- *A. Cunha Jr, M. Pereira, R. Avanço, A. M. Tusset, and J. M. Balthazar, On the reduction of nonlinear electromechanical systems, 2021*

## Documentation

**ElectroM** routines are commented to explain their functionality to the final user. Each routine has a short description of its purpose and a list of inputs and/or outputs.
